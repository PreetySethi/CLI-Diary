Concise explanation of **Session Hijacking**â€”broken down into understandable parts with key concepts, types, techniques, and prevention tips.

## ðŸ›‘ What Is **Session Hijacking**?

**Session hijacking** is an attack where a malicious actor takes over a userâ€™s active session with a web application, typically by stealing or predicting a **session ID** (a unique token used to identify a user after login).

The goal: **gain unauthorized access** to a userâ€™s account without needing their password.

## ðŸ”‘ How Sessions Work (Quick Recap)

1. User logs in â†’ server verifies credentials.
2. Server assigns a **session ID** (e.g., in a cookie).
3. This ID is sent with every request to prove the user is authenticated.
4. If an attacker obtains this ID â†’ they impersonate the user.

## ðŸ§ª Common Session Hijacking Techniques

### 1. **Session Sniffing**

* Capturing traffic over insecure networks (like open Wi-Fi).
* Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump.
* Works if session IDs are sent unencrypted (e.g., no HTTPS).

### 2. **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**

* Attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a website.
* Script steals session cookies using `document.cookie`.

### 3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**

* Attacker intercepts communication between user and server.
* Can happen on unsecured public networks.

### 4. **Session Fixation**

* Attacker sets a known session ID for the victim (e.g., via a link).
* If the app accepts this fixed ID, attacker can reuse it after login.

### 5. **Brute Forcing Session IDs**

* Poorly generated session tokens (predictable or short) can be guessed.

Real-World Example

Imagine you log into your bank on public Wi-Fi without HTTPS. An attacker on the same network uses Wireshark to sniff your session ID. They copy the ID into their browserâ€”and now theyâ€™re in your account without knowing your password.

## âœ… How to Prevent Session Hijacking

For Developers:

* Use **HTTPS** everywhere to encrypt session IDs in transit.
* Implement **Secure**, **HttpOnly**, and **SameSite** flags on cookies.
* Use strong, random, long **session tokens**.
* Regenerate session IDs after login and privilege changes.
* Implement **session timeouts** and logout features.
* Detect anomalies (IP changes, user-agent mismatches).

For Users:

* Always check for `https://` in the URL.
* Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi.
* Log out when doneâ€”donâ€™t just close the tab.
* Use VPNs on public networks.
