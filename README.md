Welcome to my **weekly cybersecurity learning log**!  
Here, I track my progress, learning, and personal development in the fields of **ethical hacking**, **network security**, **Linux tools**, and **Python scripting** as part of my **MTech** and **self-paced upskilling**.

---

## 🧠 **What I'm Currently Learning**
- **Ethical Hacking** 🕵️‍♂️  
  Exploring tools like **nmap**, **Wireshark**, and basic **Linux hacking techniques**.

- **Network Security** 🔐  
  Focusing on firewalls, VPNs, encryption methods, and **intrusion detection systems**.

- **Python for Cybersecurity** 🐍  
  Building scripts for automation, network analysis, and vulnerability scanning.

## 🌟 **Key Projects**
Here are a few of my recent projects that showcase my learning and skill development:

- 🔗 [**Network Sniffer (Wireshark)**](https://github.com/PreetySethi/Network-Sniffer)  
  A simple Python tool to sniff and capture packets from network traffic.

- 🔗 [**Ethical Hacking Lab**](https://github.com/PreetySethi/Ethical-Hacking-Lab)  
  Practice penetration testing and vulnerability scanning in a controlled environment.

- 🔗 [**TCP Chat Application**](https://github.com/PreetySethi/TCP-conference-chat)  
  A multi-user chat application built using TCP sockets for secure communication.

## 📚 **Learning Resources**
Here are some resources I'm using to expand my knowledge:

- 🌐 [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/)  
- 📘 [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- 📚 [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Application-Hackers-Handbook-Exploitation/dp/1118026470)

## 📌 **Goals**
- **Next Week**: TryHackMe "Intro to Pentesting" room
- **Goal by August 2025**: Complete a small CTF and document results
- **Long-Term**: Master network security protocols and begin job applications in the cybersecurity field
